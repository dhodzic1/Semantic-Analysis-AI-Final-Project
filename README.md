# Semantic-Analysis-AI-Final-Project

Note: The following project was completed for the course CSC 434 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, offered at The College of Brockport.

Date Submitted: 12/2021, Fall Semester

**Project Target**: The goal of this project is to build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model which utilizes multilabel classification to perform the task of semantic analysis upon a set of data.

Built with -
* Tensorflow

Associated Packages - 
* Keras
* nltk
* pandas

The code written was heavily referenced from the textbook, _"Deep learning with python"_ by Francois Chollet [1].
